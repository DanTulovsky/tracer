## Notes

- When rendering glass, et both transparency and reflectivity to high values, 0.9 or 1.
- Reflected and Refracted colors tend to make objects brighter. Tone down diffuse and ambient to compensate.
- For tinted glass or colored mirror, use a very dark color.  The more reflective or transparent the surface, the darker its surface color should be.  Make sure there is some diffuse or ambient, or it will render as black.
- Reflective and transparent surfaces pair well with right specular highlights.  Set specular to 1 and bump shininess to 300.
